# jpg-to-bmp-dasar_haartrain
<h3>For generating HAAR classifier one has to make positive of type .bmp, but generally camera images are .jpg. 
This Python script will help generating .bmp images.</h3>
<h4>Step1:</h4>
<p>Clone the repo. Two files will be there<br>1. main.py<br>2.requirements.txt</p>
<h4>Step2:</h4>
<p>Open command prompt to this directory. Run pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
<h4>Step3:</h4>
<p>Go to the rawdata folder of "dasar_haartrain". It is something like \dasar_haartrain\positive\rawdata.<br>
Copy and paste the <em>main.py</em> at this directory where all tens of hundreds of positive .jpg will be there. Create
a folder named bmp in the rawdata folder. Now run the main.py. New .bmp files will be in bmp folder. Now delete main.py and all other images
(don't forget to keep backup of .jpg images elsewhere). Cut the .bmp files from bmp folder and paste it to rawdata folder. At last
delete bmp folder</p>
<h4>Step4:</h4>
<p>Done!</p>
